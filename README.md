my first website using html5 
i know this website might seem racist and unprofessional at first, but by no means, 
i'm a swell guy, i'm a nice enough guy, i'm a cool kinda guy, heh, I'm a pretty groovy guy. 
But then I get a little SUGAR in me and I start to go Kukoo. 
Doesn't have to be much, this tme around it was 2 of, 2 of them Fiber One Brownies, only 90 calories each! 
But they do the job, do y'know what I'm sayin? They get me going, they get me riled up! A littlecuckoo, a little wacky. 
Start gettng me a little Coocy, a little, y'know loopy! oo-oo! 
Hey somebody t-somebody put this kid in a padded cell, get him a straight jacket he's going a little... Wackyyyy. 
A little Coocy. He's off the walls, bananas, loco. You want me to stop, isn't that wonderful? 
Well let me just dowhatever you say because it's your little fairytale!
